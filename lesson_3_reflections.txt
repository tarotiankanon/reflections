When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we need to collaborate with two or more coders
When we want to back-up or hosted our files onto the Github cloud system
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We want to pull changes manually because if not, the code from new commits might interfered with our existing code
Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: copy repo remotely, from GitHub to GitHub. Clone: copy repo from remote to local. Branch: Diverge out from master branch
