What hapens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it
.git folder is created in the initialized repository to keep track of our files, we need to initialize to state that the directory is managed by VCS
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area allows us to choose which file we want to make commits to. Sometime not all files in the working repository should be committed.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Choose only the file that is redundant
